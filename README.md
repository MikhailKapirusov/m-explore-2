# m-explore-2
Improved version of the standard m-explore package

## Background
In 2022, as part of my final qualifying work, I chose the topic “Autonomous navigation system for a mobile robot.”
The task was set to improve the existing m-explore algorithm for working with a stereo camera/camera (without Lidar). 
The improvement consists in creating an algorithm for turning the front of the robot towards the research control point.
As a result, it was decided to call the algorithm m-explorer-2.
The original research algorithm is available at the link: github.com/hrnr/m-explore

## Instalation

1. Put m-explore-2 to ../catkin_ws/src/
2. Run the command cutkin_make
3. Run the ROS (roscore)
4. Run th command roslaunch ../catkin_ws/src/m-explore_2/explore/launch/explore.launch

## Results

Below are screenshots of the m-explore-2 research algorithm.
